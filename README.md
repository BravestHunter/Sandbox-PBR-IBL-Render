# Sandbox

Sandbox is 3D game engine. It's my first experience in computer graphics so far.

## Idea
Here I want to create a small game engine, with different functional parts, and with different graphics APIs in future. So this is my first attempt to fit these ideas in one project.
In this project I also would like to find out a good balance between flexibility and performance in graphics application.

## Features
* Loading gltf2 models using tinygltflib (no animations supported)
* Render models using Opengl API
* PBR/IBL
* Some weird architecture
